# Repo Naming Best Practices

## Repository security
It is strongly suggested to make your repositories "private" instead of "internal". 
Internal repositories are visible by anyone in the organziation. 
You should create a team and give the team access to the private repository.
Public repositories require approval. If you want a public repo, please contact us to get the process started.

## Creating a repository name

- Should be lowercase
- Each fragment should be seperated with a dash
- Should be at least 2 fragments (agency and project/team name)

### Contents and order of fragments

1. Short code for agency or division [dgo, dts, dps, udot, etc.]
2. Project or Team name
3. Type of code/artifact [ws, terraform, fe, client, api, webapp, etc.]

**Example:** dhrm-jobs-ws
