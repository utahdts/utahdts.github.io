# Repo Naming Best Practices

## Creating a repository name

- Should be lowercase
- Each fragment should be seperated with a dash
- Should be at least 2 fragments (agency and project/team name)

### Contents and order of fragments

1. Short code for agency or division [dgo, dts, dps, udot, etc.]
2. Project or Team name
3. Type of code/artifact [ws, terraform, fe, client, api, webapp, etc.]

**Example:** dhrm-jobs-ws
